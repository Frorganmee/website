        <p>This is a small website meant to show who I am.</p>
        <h2>So who am I?</h2>
        <p>
        	I am Lev and I am currently 17 years old.<br>
            I enjoy coding in my spare time, I have skills in HTML (like this site) and   Python, although I want to learn other languages, for now, this is it.<br>
        </p>
        <h2>Do I have hobbies?</h2>
        <p>
        	Well of course, I enjoy gaming in my spare time but also arts like drawing and making music on my laptop.<br>
            I'm also really interested in chemistry and physics. And I also think this field is what I wanna major in.<br>
